<p class="big"> John is a university student and is addicted to chocolate. One day he attends to a competition and wins a prize worth 50 Euro. He will receive his prize 2 months from now. He can choose to receive his prize in the form of chocolate bars or cash. According to the rules of the award committee he can declare his preference either immediately or 2 months from now. The committee also states that, if he declares his preferred payment option immediately, he will not be allowed to switch to the other option later on.</p>
<p class="big"> John would prefer to receive his prize in the form of cash. If he declares his preference not immediately but 2 months later, he thinks that in the future he will be tempted to choose chocolate bars rather than cash. In order to avoid this he immediately sends an e-mail to the award committee and declares that he would like to receive his payment in the form of cash. 
John takes his future motives into account when he makes choices. </p>

<p class="big"> John is a university student. In his history class students receive group assignments every week. Every Saturday John meets with the other group members and together they work on the assigment. Since each group member has a different opinion, they often have to discuss for hours before they reach a consensus. John is not happy with this situation because he would like to spend more time with his family on Saturdays.</p>
<p class="big"> One day John shares his feelings with the other group members. After a discussion, they decide to split each assignment into equal parts and assign each part to a group member. They think that if each individual works on his part individually, they can finish the assigment much more quickly since they will not have to discuss for hours.</p>
<p class="big"> After they switch to this new arrangement, their assignment grades fall dramatically. It turns out that when they work separately, they spend relatively less effort. As a result, when each member works individually the quality of their work is much poorer.</p>
